Here in JobsPage, we add jobs and its payment rate per hour. Then we click on the job listed and create a time tracker by selecting a time frame.   
Finally when we created a job and its time frame, it appears inside that particular job. We can also update,delete jobs and its entries inside it.

  Lastly we have a Entry page that all the entries listed by new to old in order of date created.
